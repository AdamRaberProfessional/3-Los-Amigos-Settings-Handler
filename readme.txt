This is how I got my settings and images for Viwards, and it is very similar to how I get the info for 
different stores for the white-labelled version of Viwards.

One of the main things I changed since I made the video switching the store JSON keys from the store names
to store_1, store_2 ect. I also cut out the use of firebase as the settings storage, and now use only cpanel
to store the settings and images.
