This is how I get my JSON store data and images for Viwards. I really debated posting this, but I think it really
showcases my ability to do HTTPS requests, use internet JSON files for rendering, and make use of asynchronous
programming. I figured if someone gets to the point where they can use this against my company (ex. they get access to
the source code), I'm already done for with or without this file online.


This file downloads a list of settings and image numbers. Then it checks previously saved settings and image numbers.
If settings and images numbers both match, it will download both. If one matches, it will only download either the
settings or the images.
There are also many other reasons why it would download them. If there were no previous settings, or there was an error
last time getting either, then it automatically re-downloads everything. There is a video demonstration of how this
process works. The link for this video is in the description of my video portfolio in my resume.

p.s. I also know how to use .then() statements with promises, but they didn't make sense for this type of project where
everything needs to read like regular code.
